The uploaded file must not exceed 5 MB. If the width of the image exceeds the text width of the document, the image is automatically resized to 5 inches. User must label their figure or table caption with "Figure 1:...". Also, there is an unfortunate bug where the form stops auto-saving as soon as you upload an image. Hoping to fix that...\relax }}{}}
